**Description:**

I conceptualized, designed, and developed a modern web-based Todo App using React.js and TypeScript, combining my passion for user-friendly interfaces with my coding expertise. The project aimed to create an efficient task management tool that enhances productivity and user experience.

**Key Achievements:**

- Built a dynamic and responsive web application for creating, editing, and organizing tasks, providing users with a streamlined task management solution.
- Leveraged the power of React.js to create a component-based architecture, enabling the app to efficiently handle state changes and updates.

- Utilized state management with React hooks, ensuring real-time updates and synchronization across the app.
- Integrated data persistence using browser's local storage, allowing users to retain their tasks even after closing the app.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Proficiency in React.js and Typescript for building interactive and dynamic web applications.
- Component-based architecture and state management using React hooks.
- User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design principles for creating intuitive and visually appealing interfaces.
- Local data persistence and storage manipulation with browser local storage.
- Task categorization, filtering, and sorting functionality to enhance task organization.
- React Router integration for creating dynamic and navigable user interfaces.
